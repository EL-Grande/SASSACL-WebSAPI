# SASSACL-WebSAPI
The SASSCAL WebSAPI   deploys  web scraping and data wrangling techniques to enhance access to SASSCAL weather data and  ultimately generate desired data sets.  TheSASSCAL WebSAPI currently allows the extraction of datafrom one station at time; using some user inputs like station name. I am currently working on the functionalities to extract and analyse  data  from  multiple  AWSs  at  a  go.
