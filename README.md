# SASSACL-WebSAPI
The SASSCAL WebSAPI   deploys  web scraping and data wrangling techniques to enhance support access the SASSCAL weather data. The WebSAPI also fascilitates
  the generation of desired data sets for further data visualisation and analysis.  The SASSCAL WebSAPI currently allows the extraction of datafrom one station at time; using some user inputs like station name. I am currently working on the functionalities to extract and analyse  data  from  multiple  AWSs  at  a  go.
